The AI engineer successfully developed the Coffee Table application from initial concept to a feature-rich MVP. The development process was iterative, starting with a core Hyperbeam integration and incrementally adding collaboration features like shareable rooms, real-time chat/presence, and UI customizations. Challenges such as Hyperbeam VM limits and Kubernetes Ingress issues were addressed proactively, leading to the implementation of a Mock Mode and an HTTP polling fallback for WebSockets. The engineer consistently adhered to system constraints regarding environment variables, URL prefixes, and testing protocols. The trajectory demonstrates a structured approach, frequent automated testing, and effective adaptation to external blockers, culminating in detailed guidance for infrastructure-level configuration.

The user's primary goal was to create a virtual browser room application, named Coffee Table, utilizing Hyperbeam's API. This application needed to embed shared cloud browser sessions and provide control over volume settings, all within a clean, mobile-first React UI.

The implemented features include:
1.  **Session Management**: Create, retrieve, and terminate Hyperbeam virtual browser sessions.
2.  **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface for inputting Hyperbeam API keys, setting a start URL, defining session width/height, a fullscreen toggle, and customizable aesthetics (background gradients/images, frame styles, looping idle video).
3.  **Collaborative Functionality**:
    *   **Shareable Rooms**: Ability to generate short codes to share active sessions, allowing others to join without an API key.
    *   **Real-time Presence & Chat**: Draggable, resizable chat head overlays for user presence, a basic chat panel, and synchronization of messages and chat head movements across users.
    *   **Audio Control**: Separate volume sliders for the embedded browser media and the chat audio.
4.  **Resilience**: A Mock Mode was introduced to simulate sessions for testing when Hyperbeam API limits are reached. A robust HTTP polling fallback ensures real-time chat and presence function even if WebSocket connections are blocked by the deployment environment.
5.  **Personalization**: Customizable launch icons (emoji, color, background) with preset URL options (e.g., YouTube, Netflix) and a floating dock button for mobile.

    -   **Importance**: This file contains the FastAPI application, defining all backend API endpoints and WebSocket routes. It handles Hyperbeam API proxying, MongoDB operations for session and room data, and real-time event management (both WebSocket and HTTP polling).
    -   **Changes**: Initially set up with Hyperbeam session CRUD (), then extended to include room management (), WebSocket endpoints (), and HTTP polling endpoints (). It uses  for database access and ensures all routes are prefixed with .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The primary React component, responsible for the entire user interface, client-side logic, state management, and interaction with the backend and Hyperbeam SDK.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented UI elements for Hyperbeam key input, session creation/termination, embedded browser display (iframe/SDK), fullscreen, and extensive customization options. It integrates the  SDK for enhanced controls, including a browser volume slider. It features client-side logic for Mock Mode, shareable rooms, and real-time chat/presence using both WebSocket and HTTP polling logic. Recent updates added customizable launch icons with presets and a mobile floating dock button, with settings persisted in . All backend API calls use  and are prefixed with .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides the styling for the application using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Contains styling for all UI components, including dynamic styles for customization, chat heads, chat windows, and the recently added launch icon and mobile dock.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes**: The  SDK was added as a dependency during its integration.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Hyperbeam VM Capacity**: The user needs to address the  by either freeing up active Hyperbeam VMs or upgrading their plan to enable full Real Mode functionality.
-   **Kubernetes Ingress Configuration for WebSockets**: The user must configure their Kubernetes Ingress (e.g., NGINX) to correctly route WebSocket traffic to  to enable native WebSocket communication, thus avoiding the HTTP polling fallback.
-   **UI Enhancement (Optional)**: Adding a small presence avatar list with online counts and typing indicators.
-   **UI Enhancement (Optional)**: Adding a mini preset gallery for launch icons.

<current_work>
The Coffee Table application is a fully functional full-stack solution built with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, designed for shared virtual browsing sessions.

**Current State of Features:**
1.  **Hyperbeam Integration**: Supports creating, getting, and terminating Hyperbeam sessions. It attempts to mount the  SDK for interactive controls and a live browser volume slider in Real Mode, gracefully falling back to an iframe if the SDK fails.
2.  **Mock Mode**: A comprehensive client-side Mock Mode allows users to simulate all session-related flows (create, share, join, terminate) and UI interactions without needing a live Hyperbeam API key or consuming VM capacity.
3.  **Collaborative Rooms**: Users can create unique share codes for their active sessions, enabling others to join and co-control the same virtual browser without providing an API key.
4.  **Real-time Communication**:
    *   **Presence**: Draggable and resizable chat head avatars represent users, with their positions and sizes synchronized in real-time across connected clients.
    *   **Chat**: A basic chat panel allows text-based communication between users in a shared room.
    *   **Resilient Real-time Layer**: The application prioritizes WebSocket connections for real-time updates (). However, if WebSockets are blocked (e.g., due to Kubernetes Ingress misconfiguration, which currently causes a 404), it seamlessly falls back to HTTP polling () to maintain real-time functionality. A Live WS or Live Poll indicator in the UI shows the active communication mode.
    *   **Termination Cleanup**: When a session is terminated, a  event is broadcast, ensuring all connected peers clear their local session state, presence, and messages.
5.  **Personalization & UX**:
    *   **Customizable Launch Icons**: Users can design a personalized launch icon (emoji, text color, background style) which persists in .
    *   **Preset Launcher**: The launch icon can be configured to quickly start a session with a predefined URL preset (e.g., YouTube, Netflix) or a custom Start URL.
    *   **Mobile Floating Dock**: A toggleable, bottom-right floating button provides one-handed access to the launch functionality on mobile devices.

All critical features are automated-tested and working in Mock Mode, and largely functional in Real Mode, subject to external Hyperbeam VM availability and correct WebSocket ingress configuration. The backend strictly adheres to  prefixes, uses environment variables for URLs and MongoDB, and employs UUIDs for database identifiers.

The last completed task was the implementation of customizable launch icons with URL presets and a mobile floating dock. Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer provided detailed instructions for configuring Kubernetes NGINX Ingress to enable WebSockets, as this remains a blocker for native real-time communication.
