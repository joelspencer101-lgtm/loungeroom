The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Coffee Table application from a basic MVP to a feature-rich, collaborative platform. Initial efforts focused on debugging a non-functional Hyperbeam integration, which was traced to frontend compilation errors and a missing SDK, then fixed. This allowed for core session management. Subsequent development heavily focused on user experience and advanced features. The engineer implemented a complete UI overhaul, introducing a desktop-like homepage, draggable app icons, true fullscreen, and dynamic Bluey-themed backgrounds. Advanced Hyperbeam features like persistence, multicursor, Chrome extension management, dynamic resizing, and intelligent session timeout were integrated. A major addition was WebRTC-based video call functionality embedded within floating chat bubbles. Finally, the app received polish with custom icon uploads, mouse-interactive, draggable session controls, and pre-installed Chrome extensions, making it a professional-grade virtual collaboration platform. The work consistently involved testing, bug fixing, and iterative feature addition, successfully addressing all user requests for functionality and UI/UX enhancements.

The primary goal was to build Coffee Table, a virtual browser room using Hyperbeam. Initial requirements included session management, a mobile-first React UI for Hyperbeam key/URL input, fullscreen toggle, customizable aesthetics, and collaborative features like shareable rooms, real-time presence/chat, and audio control. Resilience through Mock Mode and HTTP polling fallback was crucial. Personalization included customizable launch icons and a mobile dock.

Subsequent user requests expanded functionality significantly:
1.  **Core Functionality Fix**: Resolve Hyperbeam session launch failures.
2.  **UI/UX Overhaul**: Create a desktop-like homepage with draggable app icons, true fullscreen (eliminating black bars), quick background switching (Bluey themes), embedded games, and custom app bookmarks.
3.  **Advanced Hyperbeam Integration**: Implement session persistence, multicursor, Chrome extension management, dynamic resizing, and a smart session timeout with user warnings.
4.  **Real-time Collaboration**: Integrate WebRTC-based video calling into floating chat bubbles with individual controls.
5.  **Final Polish**: Enable custom app icon uploads, implement mouse-interactive, draggable, and auto-hiding session controls, and pre-install specified Chrome extensions.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, using MongoDB for data storage, all deployed within a Kubernetes environment.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Central FastAPI application, handling all backend API endpoints and WebSocket routes. Manages Hyperbeam API proxying, MongoDB operations for session/room data, and real-time events.
    -   **Changes**: Extended from basic Hyperbeam session management to include room management, WebSocket () and HTTP polling () endpoints for real-time features. Strictly uses  and  prefixes. No significant functional changes were made to this file within this specific trajectory, primarily serving as a stable API for frontend enhancements.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core React component, encompassing the entire UI, client-side logic, state management, and interactions with the backend and Hyperbeam SDK. This file saw the most extensive changes.
    -   **Changes**:
        *   **Initial Fixes**: Resolved ESLint issues and updated  SDK (v0.0.37) for successful Hyperbeam session launch.
        *   **UI/UX Overhaul**: Implemented a desktop view, removing the New Tab button, replacing Terminate with Close Session (returning to desktop).
        *   **Fullscreen Fixes**: Addressed black bars by ensuring true fullscreen display with  and proper CSS.
        *   **Personalization**: Added a quick background selector with Bluey themes, set a default background, and integrated embedded games (Bluey Keepy Uppy, Magic Xylophone) with custom icons.
        *   **Draggable Elements**: Made app icons draggable (positions saved to ), and implemented mouse-interactive (auto-hide/show) draggable session controls (position saved to ).
        *   **Advanced Hyperbeam**: Integrated features like session persistence, multicursor, Chrome extension manager, dynamic resize, and smart timeout with a warning modal.
        *   **Video Call**: Implemented WebRTC-based video chat into floating chat bubbles with camera/mic controls, leveraging existing chat signaling.
        *   **Custom Content**: Added custom app icon upload functionality (storing uploaded image URLs in ) and configured specific pre-installed Chrome extensions.
        *   **Error Fixes**: Addressed a critical JavaScript error related to event target handling and CSS  issues affecting desktop clicks.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides global and component-specific styling using Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes**: Updated extensively to support the new UI/UX features, including styling for draggable app icons, fullscreen adjustments, background selector, video chat bubbles, custom icon previews, and auto-hide/show session controls. CSS for  was adjusted for desktop interactivity.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Updated  to version . No other new dependencies were explicitly mentioned as being added.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Documents testing protocols and results.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to reflect the debugging process (backend working, frontend issues), successful fixes, and verification of all new features (UI, advanced Hyperbeam, video chat, custom icons, draggable controls).

<current_work>
The Coffee Table application has evolved into a highly functional, professional-grade virtual collaboration platform.

**Hyperbeam Integration**: Fully functional, supporting session creation, sharing, and termination. It now includes advanced Hyperbeam features:
*   **Persistence**: Browser state is saved between connections, user-specific.
*   **Multicursor**: Multiple users can see each other's color-coded cursors in real-time.
*   **Chrome Extensions**: An extension manager allows loading custom  files and includes pre-installed extensions (three specific IDs) that auto-load in sessions.
*   **Dynamic Resize**: Browser automatically adjusts to container size changes, ensuring perfect aspect ratios, especially in fullscreen.
*   **Smart Timeout**: An activity tracker warns users at 58 minutes of inactivity and disconnects after a 2-minute grace period if no response.

**Core User Interface (UI)**: The app features a clean, desktop-like homepage with:
*   **Draggable App Icons**: Users can freely arrange app icons (YouTube, Netflix, games, custom apps) on the desktop, with positions saved to .
*   **Customizable Apps**: Users can add their own bookmarked apps with custom names, URLs, and now, custom image icons uploaded through a dedicated system (PNG/JPG/SVG support, previews,  persistence). Default icons are also available.
*   **Bluey Backgrounds**: A quick selector allows switching between 10 Bluey-themed room backgrounds, with Lounge set as the default.
*   **Embedded Games**: Pre-configured Bluey games (, ) are available as app icons.

**Collaboration & Communication**:
*   **Real-time Chat & Presence**: Draggable/resizable chat heads and a chat panel. WebSockets are prioritized, with an HTTP polling fallback.
*   **Video Call Integration**: Live WebRTC-based video feeds are embedded directly into the draggable chat bubbles. Users can toggle camera and microphone, supporting multi-user video conferencing with a smart UI overlay.

**Session Controls & Fullscreen**:
*   **Mouse-Interactive Controls**: Session controls (Desktop, Fullscreen, Chat, Share) auto-hide after 3 seconds of mouse inactivity, reappearing on hover. They are fully draggable via a handle, with positions saved to .
*   **True Fullscreen**: The Hyperbeam browser now properly fills the entire screen, eliminating black bars with , offering a truly immersive experience with optional chat overlay.
*   **Homepage Toggle**: A Back to Desktop button allows users to return to the icon-based homepage from an active session, making the browser visible only when an app is launched.

The application is robust, mobile-responsive, and provides a polished, professional virtual collaboration experience, with all recent features thoroughly implemented and tested.
